To run the file simply run the following command in your terminal or IDE:
            python ebike_survey_response.py


If you want to view the histograms, uncomment line 127 in ebike_survey_response.py

When running the code, please be aware that I had issues with the histograms and getting all the ticks to include the
names lead to some messy diagrams. Some diagrams looked better when uncommenting line 121 in ebike_survey_response.py,
while others looked better without this line with a little window resizing. The attached document has a better view of
the important histograms.
